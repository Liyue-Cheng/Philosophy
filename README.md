### Grand Unified Theory of Social Sciences (社会科学大一统理论)

A philosophical framework that attempts to provide a unified foundation for social sciences, using **emotional needs** as the core concept.

**Structure:**

1. **Ontology** - Establishes emotional needs as the foundational concept, bypassing unsolvable metaphysical problems
2. **Language and Meaning** - Proposes a "pointer model" of language, integrating Aristotelian and Wittgensteinian perspectives
3. **Epistemology** - Discusses the limitations of symbols and theories as incomplete models of reality
4. **Social Concepts** - Reinterprets rights, duties, morality, justice, and democracy through the lens of emotional needs
5. **Ethics** - Addresses Hume's problem, good and evil, and principles for ethical construction
