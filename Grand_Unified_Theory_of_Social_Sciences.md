## Grand Unified Theory of Social Sciences

### Part One: Ontology

#### Faith: The Existence of the External World

The material world and other individuals exist, and we come to know them through our senses and inner world. This is something that must be believed through faith.

You can never refute the brain-in-a-vat hypothesis or simulation theory, nor can you prove the problem of other minds.

These types of problems are structurally impossible to solve. Like perpetual motion machines, solving them is unrealistic, so my theory bypasses these problems and begins directly from a foundational belief.

#### [Core Definition: Emotional Needs]

Emotional needs refer to the totality of all driving forces within the inner world of sentient beings, not limited to simple emotions like joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness.

The choice of emotional needs as the theoretical foundation is based on the following characteristics:

1.  **Metaphysical Independence**: It remains valid regardless of the existence of God, the authenticity of the world, or the chemical nature of the brain.
2.  **Unambiguity**: Everyone understands what emotional needs refer to.
3.  **Infinite Extension**: Everyone knows the infinite extension of emotional needs.
4.  **No Interpretive Disputes**: There will never be disputes over interpretation rights.
5.  **Self-Referential Closure**: Refutations of it perfectly loop back to itself, with no self-referential paradox, similar to Descartes' "I think, therefore I am."

#### [Axiom Set of Emotional Needs]

"Axioms" here are not axioms in the logical sense, but rather objective laws of emotional needs—any theory that ignores these laws will lead to disaster.

*   **Axiom 1**: Emotional needs exist.
*   **Axiom 2**: Emotional needs have structure and tendencies.
*   **Axiom 3**: Emotional needs have both universality and individuality.
*   **Axiom 4**: Emotional needs have contradictions and tensions.
*   **Axiom 5**: Emotional needs have both innate and acquired aspects.
*   **Axiom 6**: Emotional needs have both malleable and immutable aspects.
*   **Axiom 7**: Emotional needs have both analyzable and unanalyzable aspects.
*   **Axiom 8**: Emotional needs have both stable and fluid aspects.
*   **Axiom 9**: Emotional needs have qualitative texture, can be weighed, but cannot be quantified.
*   **Axiom 10**: Emotional needs do not correspond one-to-one with external behavior.

#### Universality and Individuality of Emotional Needs, Reducible and Irreducible

**Universality**: Mainly includes survival and safety, connection and belonging, autonomy and competence, cognition and exploration, transcendence and spirituality, etc.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs can explain part of the universality of emotional needs, but these needs are actually interconnected and not necessarily hierarchical.

**Individuality**:

There are two levels: one is the way of satisfying universal needs, and the other is the essentially irreducible individual emotional needs, mainly including vibe, narrative, and fondness.

Vibe: Vibe is a deeply rooted, holistic preference and persistent pursuit within an individual's inner world for a certain "life texture," "collection of feelings," or "meaning landscape"—it itself constitutes a real, irreducible, and unique emotional need.

Narrative: Narrative is an individual's deep identification with and inner longing for a certain "life story pattern" or "way of meaning unfolding"—it concerns "how my life should unfold" and "what kind of story should all my experiences form." This preference for a specific narrative structure itself constitutes a unique emotional need that cannot be reduced to simple goal achievement.

Fondness: Fondness is a holistic, positive emotional attachment that an individual develops toward a specific person, thing, or object—difficult to decompose into specific reasons or functions. It does not arise because the other party satisfies an enumerable list of needs, but rather is a "just like it, can't explain why" unique emotional experience with self-sufficient value. This experience itself is the end, not reducible.

**Common Characteristics of the Three (as typical representatives of individual emotional needs):**

1. **Holism**: They are all "Gestalt"-like holistic experiences that cannot be dismantled into the sum of several independent, more basic needs.
2. **Uniqueness**: Their specific content varies from person to person, being the product of each individual's unique life journey.
3. **Irreducibility**: Attempts to fully explain them with universal needs such as "safety needs," "belonging needs," and "achievement needs" will always miss some key core parts that constitute their unique charm.
4. **Self-Sufficient Value**: Pursuing and experiencing them is itself the goal, not a means to other ends.

Individual emotional needs usually cannot be reduced to universality and have their own holistic unique charm.

#### On Emotion and Reason

Emotional capacity is a precious gift of life, allowing each person to have the possibility of constructing meaning in an absurd universe—something reason cannot achieve as an ultimate purpose.

In situations where the universe may undergo heat death and the world may perish, allowing each person to still have the capacity for action is, I believe, closer to the underlying logic of sentient beings than reason.

Reason should be more of a friend to emotion, helping us recognize, examine, organize, and coordinate emotional needs. But the driving force of life cannot be replaced by reason.

#### Understanding Happiness

The recognition, exploration, satisfaction, and response to emotional needs are directly linked to human happiness.

Happiness is simple: recognize your emotional needs, then handle them well.

Additionally, everyone has the final interpretive authority over their own happiness.

Note: This is a thesis, not a definition, like the Church-Turing thesis. I believe defining such a fundamental concept is very arrogant and does not conform to how language actually works.

#### Response to Nihilism

Nihilism is not an essence, but a man-made mental illness.

Certain limited theories sever the connection between people and their emotions and life experiences. When this theory is falsified, you are left suspended in mid-air, having lost all meaning in life.

"God is dead" is not the real problem; the real problem is that you chose God as the sole source of life's value.

It's like a factory that has closed down, leaving behind a polluted piece of land.

### Part Two: Language and Meaning

This part naturally emerged from previous reflections. Just as everyone sometimes fails to express themselves, and everyone can communicate with others using imprecise language, why?

This part involves many technical metaphors. If you don't have a background in computers and artificial intelligence, you can refer to Appendix 1.

#### The Pointer Model of Language

Language can be understood as a pointer, pointing to a region in the receiver's high-dimensional cognitive space, or "qualia." Its meaning for the user comes from dereferencing.

**Core Mechanisms:**

1.  **Dereferencing Comes with Contextual Modification**: The value each person dereferences may differ in different contexts, just as the understanding of "apple" differs under an apple tree versus at an Apple product launch.
    Another simple example: "I am a good person" vs. "I am a good person, but I am not a saint." The meaning of "good person" differs here, which also supports Saussure's structuralism.

2.  **Multiple Pointers to the Same Region**: Pointers pointing to the same region can have different names (such as apple and 苹果). This is why translation can succeed—the names are different, but the underlying experiences are similar.

3.  **Language Acquisition**: There are two models for learning language.
    *   Infants and entirely new concepts are more like the forward propagation-backpropagation model. A good example is how Violet Evergarden learned what love is.
    *   Students are more like the double pointer model.

4.  **Meaning Convergence**: Social communication (language games, watching movies, reading picture books, etc.) writes approximately the same data into each person's pointer memory space, causing the meaning of words to converge in society.

This theory integrates Aristotle's philosophy of language with later Wittgenstein's philosophy of language.

#### Social Meaning and Personal Meaning

*   **Social Meaning**: The center of convergence, which can drift.
*   **Personal Meaning**: The experience itself obtained through dereferencing.
*   **"The meaning of this matter"**: Valid, because this usage has been trained.
*   **The word "meaning" alone**: Has no meaning by itself, because it has never converged/been trained.

Just like the word "roll" in "rolling in the sheets"—does it have meaning when taken out alone? No, because "rolling in the sheets" was trained as a whole.

This passage itself is also proof of this theory—there are so many instances of "meaning" here, with different senses, but readers can understand.

#### The Limitations of Definitions

Since language derives its meaning for oneself from inner experience, and its meaning in society is the center of convergence, I believe that the definition of a word essentially does not exist, but is more of a tool to help us reach consensus.

First, reducing high-dimensional vectors/qualia to language inherently loses information, and the vocabulary used for definitions is itself associated with other inner experiences, introducing noise.

Moreover, definitions freeze the natural evolution of language. If "apple" had been defined 50 years ago, we would now have to point at an iPhone and say "that's not an apple"—which would be absurd and not in accordance with the objective laws of language.

#### Stable Self-Identity

Based on the above characteristics of language, anchoring one's self-identity entirely on labels and language is dangerous, because they are inherently unstable.

A person who has achieved self-integration should:

*   Know who they are
*   Know what they are doing
*   Know what their wishes are

The answers to these three questions should be anchored in inner experience, not in language and labels.

#### Communication Methods

On one hand, there is direct communication to emotional needs; nonviolent communication can be derived directly from this system.

On the other hand, there is multi-channel activation redundancy—when you use a divergent big word, try to supplement your meaning with convergent small words.

#### Dissolution of the "Essence" Problem

"What is the essence of human beings?" is, I believe, largely a philosophical illusion.

Because "the essence of XX is YY" is basically trained as a phrase. The convergent meaning of "essence" can be roughly described as:

*   The internal mechanism is...
*   The principle is...
*   The core driving force is...
*   The most stable behavioral tendency is...

Therefore, "the essence of humanity," "the essence of beauty," "the essence of freedom," and the essence of any abstract concept cannot possibly have a result—this is called Type Mismatch.

Worse still: concepts like justice have not converged themselves. Can something that has not converged have an objective essence? This is structurally impossible.

This passage can be understood as an interpretation of Wittgenstein's later "fly escaping from the fly bottle."

#### On "Private Language"

The most fitting expression is that private language has no socially converged meaning, but it has meaning for oneself.

Whether one says it "is language" or "is not language," neither is fitting enough.

#### Response to "Deconstruction"

> "Everything is constructed, so everything can be deconstructed"

I agree with the first half, but not the second half.

Construction is irreducible truth. After training is complete, that is you! And how could training data ever be "deconstructed"?

You cannot "deconstruct" a person's attachment to their hometown merely because "hometown" is a socially constructed concept. That attachment, as an emotional need, truly exists.

Deconstructionism also has two other problems:

1.  **Information Loss and Noise Injection**
    What exactly is justice?
    This clearly points to a high-dimensional vector, or "qualia."
    But Derrida's "différance" implies that what justice exactly is corresponds to a concept that can be self-sufficiently expressed in language. But this is impossible, because this word was trained directly with full-modal social data, not with a dictionary.
    If you explain it with concepts, when the high-dimensional vector is reduced in dimension, information has already been lost. And concepts are trained with other data, so the explanation process itself introduces noise.
    Something with information loss and noise is obviously not "the essence of justice."

2.  **Malicious Injection via Double Pointers**
    Foucault wrote "power" as illegal data into a large number of regular pointers. When dereferencing, you dereference to power, and continue to dereference, causing the negative associations of power to erode the entire memory space. You can rationally realize: the power Foucault speaks of is not the kind of "power that puts you in prison."
    But when your emotions dereference "education, love, doctor," seeing that there is a double pointer called power inside, they then dereference all the "oppression, error, need to resist" that society has trained in, making one's world turn gray.

#### Response to the "Theory of Forms"

I believe Plato had a misunderstanding: anchoring the objective existence of the center of convergence as the objective existence of real events.

The center of convergence is an emergent statistical phenomenon, not an independently existing entity.

In the case of few-shot learning, the Form is a discriminative model quickly constructed by an individual. We would not consider a neural network that can recognize cats as having grasped "the Form of cat," but it can indeed recognize new cats.

#### Loosely Coupled Theory Construction

Since definitions are inherently lossy and noisy, the tightly coupled definition chains that traditional scholars favor—using A to define B, using B to define C—are a fragile way of construction: one loosening causes the whole to collapse; one word's ambiguity pollutes the entire system.

Therefore, I extensively use "theses" rather than "definitions" here, adopting a loosely coupled construction approach: concepts maintain distance from each other, each anchored to the common foundation of emotional needs, rather than defining each other.

The benefits of doing so:

1.  **Reduced Noise**: The vagueness of one concept will not spread to other concepts.
2.  **Balancing Descriptive and Normative**: Theses allow fuzzy boundaries and acknowledge the existence of counterexamples.
3.  **Strong Fault Tolerance**: Local corrections can be made without affecting the whole.
4.  **Conforming to Linguistic Reality**: Natural language was never an axiomatic system to begin with.

***

### Part Three: Epistemology and Interfaces with Other Theories

#### The Limitations of Symbols

We understand the world through discrete language and symbols, which is imperfect, and we have already discussed this issue (later Wittgenstein/Saussure).

Ideas and theories are composed of symbols.

The expression of the inner world cannot be exhausted, but we try with symbols. All traditional psychological theories connect to this framework here.

#### The Nature of Theories

All theories are incomplete models of reality.

There is no universal truth that solves all problems.

Logic does not prove propositions in social sciences, it merely rationalizes.

This is an extrapolation application of Kant's antinomies, but I believe it is very apt given the current political debate environment.

> All models are wrong, but some are useful.

All theories in human history, after being disenchanted, are critically incorporated into this framework.

This theory is no exception; for example, the exploration of the human subconscious is not entirely deep.

Here, I adapt the philosophical view that "the map is not the territory."

#### The Mismatch Between Theory and Reality

Since it is a model, we need to consider the mismatch with reality.

The two most common mismatches are overfitting and underfitting.

*   **Overfitting**: Inappropriate extrapolation of local experience, such as Schopenhauer's theory.
*   **Underfitting**: Theories that appear correct but have no operability, such as chicken soup for the soul or Taoist philosophy.

***

### Part Four: Reinterpretation of Social Concepts

Based on the previous discussions, I believe we can have a new interpretation of some common social concepts.

Considering the low degree of convergence of the social meaning of these concepts, and to ensure the openness of discussion and the natural evolution of language, the following are all theses, or "portraits" rather than definitions. They are both descriptive and normative, and all have boundary cases and counterexamples.

*   **Rights**: Society's stabilized confirmation and institutionalized guarantee of the emotional needs of groups.
*   **Duties**: The institutionalized responsibilities that must be paid to maintain the existence of rights.
*   **Morality**: Overall, it is behavior that identifies, empathizes with, responds to, satisfies, and maintains the emotional needs of others.
*   **Fairness**: The reasonable satisfaction and dynamic reconciliation of the emotional needs of social members.
*   **Justice**: Practicing morality with your courage.
*   **Democracy**: The emotional needs of social members can be expressed equally, enter public deliberation, and receive institutional response.
*   **Social Institutions**: Structured weighing, coordination, and handling of emotional needs.
*   **Other Social Science Concepts**: Understood as emergent phenomena of emotional needs that are not easily reducible (More Is Different).

***

### Part Five: Ethics

#### Response to Hume's Problem

I basically support Hume's view of morality: morality comes from emotions, empathy, and other inner experiences.

Morality has convergence because emotional needs have universality and stability; it also has arbitrariness because emotional needs have individuality and fluidity.

Emotional needs are both "is" and the source of all "ought."

I refuse to acknowledge a moral imperative that is a priori, absolute, and unrelated to anyone's life experience.

#### Good and Evil

*   **Good**: Usually refers to behavior that responsibly identifies and responds to the emotional needs of others.
*   **Evil**: Usually refers to behavior that ignores or destroys the emotional needs of others.

Considering the limitations of language, I do not define here either, but use "usually" to describe.

Evil emotional needs cannot possibly disappear, because they sometimes bring competitive advantages, and natural selection will certainly preserve them.

Perhaps all the efforts of human civilization are not to "eradicate" these desires, but to learn how to "harness" them.

Additionally, can a person be an absolute good person? Obviously also impossible.

#### The Boundaries of Morality

The concept of morality is actually very close to good, but adds the aspect of "unwritten social norms."

I believe morality should be used to handle relationships between people, not to deal with the impact of personal choices on purely abstract systems.

Because different people sometimes have different understandings of the results of weighing, we can honestly suspend certain moral judgments as undefined states.

#### Absolute Rights

1.  It is an absolute moral standard and absolute right not to distort and hinder each person's inner exploration of their own emotional needs. (Anti-relativism)
2.  It is also an absolute right to attempt to satisfy one's own emotional needs without affecting others. (Anti-relativism)

#### Social Vision

Distinctively individual, born as one—this is a society worth pursuing.

Suppress visible evil through social construction, rather than eliminating the instinct of evil from the heart.

#### Basic Principles of Ethical Construction

Because the essence of many ethical issues is continuous, such as freedom versus security, abortion issues, etc., I believe that compared to debate, ethical restrictions should be constructed as follows:

1.  **Exploration**: Put the entire spectrum on the table.
2.  **Consensus**: Reach consensus on what step we can accept. This step is essentially arbitrary, but I believe arbitrariness is necessary.
3.  **Lock-in**: After reaching consensus, fix it for a period of time, using literature and art to evolve social consensus through thought.

This approach dissolves the slippery slope problem, because one cannot deduce that there is really no difference ethically based on "logically there is no essential difference." As we have also discussed the limitations of language earlier, it is more likely that more important dimensions were lost during dimension reduction.

***

### Conclusion: Map, Territory, and Homecoming

At this point, we have completed the preliminary construction of this thought system. We started from the simplest, most irrefutable starting point—the "emotional needs" that truly exist within each of us—and used this as the foundation, employing the "language pointer model" as a tool, to re-examine language, meaning, self, society, and even ethics.

This theory does not intend to provide a new, absolutely correct dogma to replace the old "God" or "Reason"; on the contrary, it is more like an invitation and a declaration of liberation. It aims to shift the focus of philosophy from asking "what is the world" as an external essence, back to the inner reality of "how we experience the world and settle ourselves."

It hopes we can bravely acknowledge the limitations of language and theory, and thus no longer completely entrust self-worth to fragile labels and grand narratives that may collapse at any time. It encourages us to trust our inner compass—that unique preference for certain vibes, narratives, and fondnesses—because that is what constitutes the texture of our lives, the most inalienable truth.

Ultimately, the core message of this system is simple and powerful: happiness and meaning need not be sought externally. They lie in our daring to face, and responsibly recognize, explore, coordinate, and respond to, those complex, contradictory yet utterly real emotional needs of ourselves and others. The destination of this journey is for each person to gain the final interpretive authority over their own happiness, and find the courage to practice it.

Theory is the map, and life is the territory. May this map help every traveler walk more freely and more firmly in their own territory.





### Appendix 1: Technical Terminology Explained

#### Layperson's Explanation of Technical Terms

The following explanations are provided for readers without a technical background, to help understand several metaphors borrowed from computer science and artificial intelligence in Part Two.

##### Pointers and Dereferencing

Pointer is originally a concept from computer science. When a computer stores data, it places the data at a certain location in memory, and a pointer is a record of this location's "address"—it is not the data itself, but a marker telling you "where the data is stored."

**Dereferencing** is the action of "following the address to retrieve the data."

To use an analogy: a library call number is a pointer. The call number "K835.6" is not a book itself, but it tells you which shelf and which level you can find that book. Taking the call number, going to get the book, and opening it to read—this process is "dereferencing."

In this theory, language is like a call number—each word is just a marker, pointing to a certain piece of real experience and feeling deep in your heart. When you hear a word, and corresponding feelings, images, and memories arise in your heart, this is you "dereferencing."

##### Convergence

The everyday meaning of convergence is "gradually coming together from all directions."

Imagine a group of people walking from different directions, eventually all arriving at the same plaza—this is convergence. They don't need to take exactly the same route, but the final position they reach is roughly the same.

In this theory, convergence describes this phenomenon: each person's initial understanding of a word may be slightly different, but through extensive social communication—chatting, reading, watching movies, living together—everyone's understanding of this word gradually tends to be similar. This common understanding that everyone approaches is called the **center of convergence**, which is the common meaning of a word in society.

##### Training

In the field of artificial intelligence, **training** refers to the process of letting a machine learn repeatedly through a large number of examples, gradually mastering a certain ability.

This is very similar to the human learning process. A child does not learn to recognize dogs by memorizing "the definition of a dog," but by seeing various kinds of dogs in life—big and small, black and white, gentle and fierce—being pointed to by parents saying "this is a dog" time after time, gradually building an understanding of the word "dog." This process of repeated exposure and gradual mastery is "training."

In this theory, "training" is used to describe how we acquire the meaning of language: we are not told a precise definition, but gradually feel what a word "roughly refers to" in countless specific usage scenarios.

##### Forward Propagation and Backpropagation

These two concepts come from the learning mechanism of neural networks in artificial intelligence, and can be understood using a simple everyday scenario:

*   **Forward propagation** is "try it first." You make an attempt based on your current understanding and see how the result turns out.
*   **Backpropagation** is "correcting yourself based on the result." If the result is wrong, you go back to adjust your understanding and do better next time.

For example: a two-year-old child seeing a cat for the first time, pointing at it and saying "doggy!"—this is **forward propagation**, the child made a judgment based on current cognition (four legs, furry = dog). Mom laughs and corrects: "Not a doggy, this is a kitty"—the child receives this feedback and quietly adjusts their way of distinguishing between "dog" and "cat," and may get it right next time—this process of adjustment based on feedback is **backpropagation**.

In this theory, infants learning language is precisely through this continuous "attempt—feedback—correction" cycle, gradually aligning their understanding of words with that of those around them.

##### Dimensions, Vectors, and High-Dimensional Vectors

This group of concepts usually appears together and can be understood using an analogy of "evaluating a cup of coffee."

**Dimensions**

Dimension, here can be understood as "independent angles or aspects for evaluating something."

- When you evaluate a cup of coffee, you might consider several **dimensions**: **"bitterness"** is one dimension, **"acidity"** is another dimension, **"aroma intensity"** is a third dimension, **"temperature"** is a fourth dimension, and so on.
- If you only say "this coffee is good," this is a very simple, **one-dimensional** evaluation. But if you can say it "has rich aroma, moderate acidity, but is slightly bitter," you have given a richer description from multiple dimensions.

In this theory, the reason our inner feelings (such as feelings about "justice") are complex is that they contain countless such evaluation dimensions, far more than evaluating a cup of coffee.

**Vectors**

Vector can be understood as packaging together an object's "scores" across all dimensions, forming an overall description.

- Continuing the above example, suppose we use a 1-10 scale. Your evaluation of a certain cup of coffee might be: {bitterness: 3, acidity: 7, aroma intensity: 9, temperature: 8}.
- This "packaged information" consisting of a set of numbers `[3, 7, 9, 8]` is a **vector**. It is no longer a single-dimensional evaluation, but a multi-dimensional, three-dimensional "snapshot" that more completely represents your overall experience of this cup of coffee.

In this theory, when a word (such as "home") "dereferences" in your heart, it evokes not a single feeling, but a complex experiential **vector**—it contains feeling scores across countless dimensions such as "sense of security," "sense of warmth," "familiar smells," "memories with family members."

**High-Dimensional Vectors**

High-dimensional vector is a vector with an extremely large number of dimensions.

- Evaluating coffee may only require 4-5 dimensions. But to describe the complete experience in your heart of a complex concept like "love" or "freedom" may require thousands, even countless dimensions: it relates to your childhood memories, books you've read, movies you've watched, a specific moment, an indescribable atmosphere, a certain bodily sensation, and so on.
- Such an extremely complex overall information package made up of "scores" across massive dimensions is a **high-dimensional vector**.

In this theory, "qualia" or inner experience is described as a **high-dimensional vector** precisely to emphasize its extreme richness and complexity. This is why any attempt to "define" it with a few words (low-dimensional language) is like trying to summarize `[3, 7, 9, 8]` with just the two words "good"—inevitably losing a lot of key information, or even causing misleading.

##### Fitting, Overfitting, and Underfitting

This group of words also comes from artificial intelligence and statistics, and can be understood using a "tailoring clothes" analogy.

**Fitting** refers to the degree of match between a model (or theory) and the data (or reality) it is meant to explain. Ideal **fitting** is like a well-made fitting garment that can show the general contours of your body without being too tight or too loose, comfortable and aesthetically pleasing.

- **Underfitting** is like dressing an adult in a robe made from a burlap sack with only one hole. This "garment" is too simple; it cannot describe anyone's body details. Although anyone can fit into it, it fits no one well. In this theory, an **underfitting** theory refers to those overly general "chicken soup for the soul" or "grand principles" that seem always correct but lack practical guidance. They are too simple to effectively explain and address complex real-world problems.
- **Overfitting** is like having clothes custom-made for you in a specific posture (for example, while you are bending over to pick something up). These clothes perfectly fit every muscle contour and clothing wrinkle of that moment. But when you stand up straight, these clothes are completely unwearable, because they treated temporary, accidental details (the bending posture) as permanent characteristics of your body. In this theory, an **overfitting** theory is one that inappropriately generalizes very localized, personal experiences (such as Schopenhauer's personal experiences) as universal truths explaining all phenomena. It perfectly "explains" that small portion of experience but is completely inapplicable to new, different situations.

All these technical terms in this theory are metaphorical borrowings, aimed at describing the workings of language and meaning more intuitively and precisely. Readers do not need any technical background; they just need to grasp the everyday intuition behind these metaphors.
